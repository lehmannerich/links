          <p>
            I think a lot about what it means to live a good life. I enjoy building things
            that people love. I built two companies from the ground up - one of them
            became really successful. I can code, I can write and I have never stopped
            learning.

            My core skills are shipping product and making sales. I learned this from
            building my companies, from reading Paul Graham and Jason Fried and from being
            coached by YC partners. I have all the skills necessary to do it all alone
            (build a full stack app, reach out to customers). And I have all the skills
            necessary to do it with a team (align the team on a mission, enable the devs
            to ship fast, establish repeatable sales channels, ensure constant input of
            customer feedback).
